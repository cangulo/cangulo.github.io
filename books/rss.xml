            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are my notes about <a href="https://staffeng.com/book">Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track by Will Larson</a> book.</p><h2>Staff engineer archetypes</h2><ol><li><strong>Tech Lead</strong>: He guides the approach and execution of a team. It tends to be the first <em>staff engineer</em> experience.</li><li><strong>Architect</strong>: He is responsible for the direction, quality, and approach within a specific area.</li><li><strong>Solver</strong>: He jumps into problems, finds solutions, and jumps into the next one. He is a trusted agent of the organization.</li><li><strong>Right hand</strong>: He extends an executive&#x27;s attention.</li></ol><p>Which is right for you? Start by listing the kinds of work that energize you. Next, match it with the archetypes and roles available in your company.</p><h2>What do Staff engineers actually do?</h2><ol><li>Setting technical direction</li><li>Mentorship and sponsorship</li><li>Providing engineering perspective</li><li>Exploration</li><li>Being Glue</li><li>But will you still write software?</li><li>Slow but rewarding</li></ol>]]></content:encoded>
