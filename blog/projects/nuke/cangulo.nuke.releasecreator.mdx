## Problem I want to solve

Every time I want to release a new version in my C# projects, I have to do it manually or define a custom GH action for every repo. I would like to have a general solution that makes this automatically every time I merge a PR. Also, as I have been playing with [NUKE](https://nuke.build/index.html) lately, I want to include it in the solution. 

<!--truncate-->

:::info
[NUKE](https://nuke.build/index.html) is a build automation framework where you define operations as build, test or push NuGets, in a C# project. I found good reviews and some videos in [Channel9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/On-NET/Build-Automation-with-NUKE) about it. So, for instance, dotnet commands are predefined methods, and its arguments are extension methods, check the next example:

  <summary>How a NUKE project looks like?</summary>

```csharp
Target Pack => _ => _
    .DependsOn(Clean)
    .Executes(() => 
    {
      DotNetTasks
          .DotNetPack(s => s
              .SetProject(project.Path)
              .SetOutputDirectory(outputFolderAbsolutePath)
              .SetConfiguration(configuration)
              .SetVersionPrefix(currentPackageVersion)
              .SetVersionSuffix(versionSuffix)
              .EnableNoRestore());
    });
```

## Goals

* Build a solution that releases a new version every time a PR is merged.
* The Solution should be based on NUKE.
* Any repository should be able to use it.

## Approach

cangulo.nuke.releasecreator will execute the following operations sequentially:

1. Calculate the next version based on the commits merged
2. Release a new version through the GH API client (provided by NUKE). 

Next are the requirements for calculating the release number:

* The repository app follows [Semantic Versioning.](https://semver.org)
* All PR contain [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) which set the release to be created (_major_, _minor_ or _fix_).

So, if an app has the version `0.0.2` and a PR with a _fix_ commit as  `fix: solved error in the controller` is merged, the version released will be `0.0.3`.

## Remarks

* I'm not saying NUKE is the best solution, I just want to give it a try ðŸ˜Š. In the future, I will create another solution based on scripts.
* As I started coding this, I realize that I can define more tasks as:
  * To update the version in `.csproj` files. I did this as optional.
  * To update the changelog using [cangulo.changelog](https://github.com/cangulo-nugets/cangulo.changelog)
  * To push custom Assets to the release,  like a JSON schema that we updated

## How to use it?

Please check the examples given [here](https://github.com/cangulo-actions/cangulo.nuke.releasecreator#examples).

## Where do I use it?

I call this solution through a specific [GH Action](https://github.com/cangulo-actions/cangulo.nuke.releasecreator) in the next projects:

* [cangulo-nugets/cangulo.changelog](https://github.com/cangulo-nugets/cangulo.changelog/blob/v0.0.8/.github/workflows/4-Release-New-Version.yml)
* [cangulo-nugets/cangulo.common.testing](https://github.com/cangulo-nugets/cangulo.common.testing/blob/v0.0.2/.github/workflows/4-Release-New-Version.yml)
* [cangulo-nuke/cangulo.nuke.prcommitsvalidations](https://github.com/cangulo-nuke/cangulo.nuke.prcommitsvalidations/blob/v0.0.1/.github/workflows/3-Release_New_Version.yml)
* [cangulo-actions/cangulo.nuke.prcommitsvalidations](https://github.com/cangulo-actions/cangulo.nuke.prcommitsvalidations/blob/v0.0.1/.github/workflows/2-release_new_version.yml)
* [cangulo-tf/basic-iac](https://github.com/cangulo-tf/basic-iac/blob/v0.0.2/.github/workflows/3-Release_New_Version.yml)
