This is my third post explaining my CICD tools. In this case, I'm going to explain how I use my cangulo.changelog nuget package to create the release notes. You can use it in any C# console project. I am going to refer to the [cangulo.nuke.releasecreator](https://github.com/cangulo-nuke/cangulo.nuke.releasecreator) project explained in the previous [post](../../nuke/cangulo.nuke.releasecreator/index.mdx).

## Starting Point

Let me start with some points of my [previous post](../1-idea-and-how-to-use.mdx): 

* The release process defined in [cangulo.nuke.releasecreator](https://github.com/cangulo-nuke/cangulo.nuke.releasecreator) provides the list of commits merged
* 

 I mentioned that on every release, the changes should be provided in two places:
1. The release notes
2. The changelog

Well, now we will focus on creating the release notes.

:::info
For the rest of the article I'm going to focus only on creating the release notes.

Maybe you would say, okay, why do you need a custom solution? Why don't you do it in the GH Action itself or in the _cangulo.nuke.releasecreator_ project? Well, when I started working on this I realize it was not so simple, here is what I took into account:

-   The Changelog is a Markdown (MD) file, so adding the changes is not directly appending text, we should format the text to the MD language.
-   To make the Changelog more formal we should add other elements as:
	-   Header containing the version number
	-   A Date to know when that release was created (okay, this is a _nice to have_ 😁)
	-   Future elements as contributors, PR link, Link to the tests reports executed. Yes, I'm going too far, I will keep this for future versions 😄

Although MD is easy to write, it requires to format the text when creating elements (`#` for headers `* ` for list item, etc). So, to avoid doing that logic in shell scripts or mixing domains (release process and changelog update), I decided to implement this in a separate repository, the [cangulo.changelog repository](https://github.com/cangulo-nugets/cangulo.changelog).


## Example

### Input: Commits from a merged PR
The release 0.0.2 is created after merging a PR with the next commits list:
-   _fix: Solved bug in the TransactionsController that makes transactions fail_
-   refactor: Simplified Transactions Repository
-   docs: Updated docs/examples
-   feat: Implemented new DocumentsController
-   refactor: It's possible! You can turn a 50-line code chunk into just 3 lines. Here's how -> Please never write a commit message like this 😜, you can find more funny messages [here](http://whatthecommit.com/85835a6ce3edb747ec06e42f6313d0a2).

### Output: Changelog Updated

## Did I achieve the goal?

Yes, I have created the [cangulo.changelog](https://www.nuget.org/packages/cangulo.changelog/) NuGet package. It is integrated in the [cangulo.nuke.releasecreator](https://github.com/cangulo-nuke/cangulo.nuke.releasecreator) solution, and this one updates the changelog every time it release a new version. Next are some changelogs I build using this solution.

1.  [cangulo.common.testing Changelog](https://github.com/cangulo-nugets/cangulo.common.testing/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
2.  [cangulo.nuke.prcommitsvalidations Changelog](https://github.com/cangulo-nuke/cangulo.nuke.prcommitsvalidations/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
3.  [cangulo.nuke.releasecreator Changelog](https://github.com/cangulo-nuke/cangulo.nuke.releasecreator/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

### How to use it?

1. The services required should be setup in your `startup.cs` by calling the `AddChangelogServices` method:
```csharp {8}
using cangulo.changelog.Extensions;
//...
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
		  //...
	    services.AddChangelogServices(settings);
	    //...
    }
}
```

The object passed is a `ChangelogSettings` instance. It sets the working mode (Conventional or Non Conventional Commits) in the `CommitsMode` attribute. In case you want to go with the conventional ones, you have to provide the types in the `ConventionalCommitsSettings`. 
```csharp
public class ChangelogSettings
{
  public CommitsMode CommitsMode { get; set; }
  public ConventionalCommitsSettings ConventionalCommitsSettings { get; set; }
}

public class ConventionalCommitsSettings
{
  public string[] Types { get; set; }
}
public enum CommitsMode
{
  NonConventionalCommits,
  ConventionalCommits
}
```

:::info Idea!

<details>
  <summary>Define those settings in a json file, maybe your appsettings, and parse them. Click Here to check an example</summary>

```json
{
    "commitsMode": "conventionalCommits",
    "conventionalCommitsSettings": {
        "types": [
            "fix",
            "patch",
            "refactor",
            "feat",
            "major",
            "break",
            "docs"
        ]
    }
}
```

2. Call the `Build` method  from the `IChangelogBuilder` interface to update your changelog:

```csharp
var changelogBuilder = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IChangelogBuilder>();
changelogBuilder.Build(nextVersion, commitMsgs, changelogPath);
```

<Caption label="Example at cangulo.nuke.releasecreator" linkIsRelative="false"  link="https://github.com/cangulo-nuke/cangulo.nuke.releasecreator/blob/v0.0.1/src/cangulo.nuke.releasecreator/build.changelog.cs#L33" />

<details>
  <summary>IChangelogBuilder Definition</summary>

```csharp
 public interface IChangelogBuilder
 {
     void Build(string version, string[] changes, string path);
 }
```

<Caption label="Definiton at cangulo.changelog" linkIsRelative="false"  link="https://github.com/cangulo-nugets/cangulo.changelog/blob/v0.0.8/src/cangulo.changelog/Builders/ChangelogBuilder.cs" />

## Final notes

In order to avoid making this post longer, I keep the implementation details for the next article. So far I have explained the why I created this project and how I use it.
