## Context

In my [last post](../setup-aws-account-envs/aws-control-tower-aft.mdx) I explained how I setup the services AWS Control Tower and the Account Factory for Terraform (AFT) approach. Now I'm going to talk about the costs associated.

### Latest 3 months costs:

Before continue I have to mention my usage of AFT:
* January and February were the months I use it. I created 5 AWS Accounts.
* On March I didn't create neither enroll any account. This was on purpose to check what are the fixed costs of having AFT inactive, I knew some Control Tower policies created have fixed costs no mated if you use them or not. I will dive into it in the next sections

And here we have the costs:

### Wait Carlos, were you using the Free Tier?

Yes I was, and that might reduce the final costs I had but I don't expect them to be significant neither to change any conclusion of this article. I checked the quota I had left on April 18 after not using it since later february, and for some services it was already exceed.

### Side Notes: Audit and Log AWS Accounts costs

For using AWS Control Tower there are 3 accounts required:
* Audit Account.
* Log Archive Account.
* AFT Account where all the resources to process account creation request are.

In this post I'm only referring to the AFT accounts costs. Next are all the costs
