In this post, I am going to implement an interactive bookmarks menu using fzf in bash Terminal.

<!--truncate-->

## Requirements
* Linux (I'm using [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io), a Ubuntu-based distro, check it!)
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) command-line fuzzy finder
* Remember to add execution permissions to the scripts through `chmod +x`

## Demo

![goal](goal.gif)

As you see, every time I call `listBookmarks` the following paths are listed interactively:
* /home/cangulo/repos/cangulo-tf
* /home/cangulo/repos/cangulo-nuke

I can move through them using the up/down keys, and navigate into by pressing Enter.

On the other hand, in case similar paths are listed, I can filter by typing keywords.

## Implementation

```bash file=./code/listbookmarks.sh
```

<CaptionDocusaurus label="listBookmarks function" linkIsRelative={true} link="posts/bash/1-interactive-bookmarks/code/listbookmarks.sh" />

Let me define the basic structure:
1. Read the paths (i.e. _bookmarks_)
2. List them in an interactive way
3. Once a bookmark is selected, navigate to it

Now let's dive into the details:

### 1. Read the bookmarks
First, in order to make this extensible, the paths are listed in a JSON file:

```json file=code/bookmarks.json
```

<CaptionDocusaurus label="bookmarks" linkIsRelative={true} link="posts/bash/1-interactive-bookmarks/code/bookmarks.json" />

We can print the file content using `cat`, and then use `jq` to query the array items. 

`cat $bookmarksFile  | jq -r '.[]'`

    It is because in the next article I will define more advanced bookmarks with different properties used by new features üòÅ

### 2. List the bookmarks

Here is where `fzf` comes up. Anything that `fzf`  receives is listed interactively. In this case, we pipe the `jq` result to `fzf`, so the bookmarks are listed as shown in the [demo](#demo) section.

`cat $bookmarksFile | jq -r '.[]' | fzf`

### 3. Once a bookmark is selected, navigate to it

`fzf` returns the path selected, we save it to a variable.

`local pathSelected=$(cat $bookmarksFile | jq -r '.[]' | fzf)`

Last, we check if it is not empty (`-n`) before moving into:

```bash
if [[ -n "$pathSelected" ]]; then
    cd $pathSelected
else
    echo "no bookmark selected"
fi
```
## Bonus: execute this every time you open a terminal
You have to add this in your bash or zsh profile (_.bashrc_, _.zshrc_ ). Just append the `listBookmarks` implementation at the end, update the `bookmarksFile` variable to be a full path, and call the function.

```bash
listBookmarks() {
    local bookmarksFile='YOUR_PATH/bookmarks.json'
    local pathSelected=$(cat $bookmarksFile |
        jq -r '.[]' |
        fzf)

    if [[ -n "$pathSelected" ]]; then
        cd $pathSelected
    else
        echo "no bookmark selected"
    fi
}

listBookmarks
```

And that is all! I hope this saves you some time using the terminal. Do you find this useful? Do you have similar functions? Let me know in the comments below.
