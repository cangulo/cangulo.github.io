In this post, I will explain how to load custom variables by reading a JSON file, this will be done every time we open a Terminal. I will also improve the shortcuts we create in the previous posts.

## Requirements
* Linux (I'm using [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io), a Ubuntu-based distro, check it!)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). If you don't want to use it, change all the `code` commands in the bash code for your text editor. Alternatives: _gedit_ or [gnome-text-editor](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-text-editor).
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) command-line fuzzy finder


## Notes
* Remember to add execution permissions to the scripts through `chmod +x`
* Profile script: `$HOME/.bashrc` for bash terminal and `$HOME/.zshrc` for zsh 

```json file=./code/1-profile-settings.json
```

```json file=./code/2-bookmarks.json
```

```bash file=./code/3-profile-script.sh
```

```bash file=./code/scripts/aliases-bash.sh
```

```bash file=./code/scripts/aliases-zsh.sh
```

```bash file=./code/scripts/functions.sh
```
