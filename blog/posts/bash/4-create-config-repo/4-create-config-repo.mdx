In this post, I will explain how to load custom variables by reading a JSON file, this will be done every time we open a Terminal. I will also improve the shortcuts we create in the previous posts.

:::info Template ready to use!
The [cangulo-templates/linux-terminal-profile](https://github.com/cangulo-templates/linux-terminal-profile) repository contains a ready-to-use template based on this article.
:::

## Requirements
* Linux (I'm using [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io), a Ubuntu-based distro, check it!)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). If you don't want to use it, change all the `code` commands in the bash code for your text editor. Alternatives: _gedit_ or [gnome-text-editor](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-text-editor).
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) command-line fuzzy finder


## Notes
* Remember to add execution permissions to the scripts through `chmod +x`
* Profile script: `$HOME/.bashrc` for bash terminal and `$HOME/.zshrc` for zsh 

## Problem

Simplify, as much as possible, the process to set up my shortcuts every time I migrate to a new computer, personal or work. This process is: download and setups all my scripts in the Bash profile.

## Idea

Remember the concept _Behavior vs Configuration_ I explained in my [previous post](../3-load-vars/3-load-vars.mdx#behavior-vs-configuration)? We are going to continue using it üòÅ. Let me list down the main points:

* Variables are stored in a JSON file. We want those variables to be available during all the terminal sessions.
* Functions depend on those variables, values that could change depending on the PC your use, for example paths, shouldn't be hard-coded.
* Both, variables and functions are added in the Bash Profile.

Nice, now that we have the main points, let me show the implementation.

## Implementation

First, we have the JSON file containing the variables:

```json file=./code/1-profile-settings.json
```

Each JSON key will be an environment variable, I prefer to define them in upper case to differentiate them from other variables we define during the terminal session.

Then, in the bash profile we only have to do the next actions:

1. Export the path to the JSON settings. My convention is to call this variable as `SETTINGS_FILE`.
2. Call a script to load all the variables and functions using the previous settings. Let's call this script `load-custom-profile.sh`.

Next is the code for that. Please append it in your profile.

```bash
# Update FULL_PATH_TO_JSON_SETTINGS with yours
export SETTINGS_FILE="FULL_PATH_TO_JSON_SETTINGS"
source FULL_PATH/load-custom-profile.sh
```

Please note we use the `export` keyword, which sets `SETTINGS_FILE` as an environment variable. In that way, it will be available for other scripts. Please check this [link](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/bash-variables-export) for more details.

### load-custom-profile.sh

This script should perform the next actions:

* Verify `$SETTINGS_FILE` is defined and valid:
  * String is not empty
  * Path provided exists
* Read the JSON file and export the variables. The command is based on `jq` and `eval` as explained in my [previous post](../3-load-vars/3-load-vars.mdx) for more details. The main difference now is the use of the `export` command, following the pattern: `export KEY='VALUE'`

```bash file=./code/load-custom-profile.sh
```

Next are the scripts stored in `$SCRIPTS_FOLDER`:

* aliases:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="bash" default>

```bash file=./code/scripts/aliases-bash.sh
```
<CaptionDocusaurus label="aliases-bash.sh" linkIsRelative={true} link="posts/bash/4-create-config-repo/code/scripts/aliases-bash.sh" />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="zsh" label="zsh">

```bash file=./code/scripts/aliases-zsh.sh
```
<CaptionDocusaurus label="aliases-zsh.sh" linkIsRelative={true} link="posts/bash/4-create-config-repo/code/scripts/aliases-zsh.sh" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

* functions:

```bash file=./code/scripts/functions.sh
```

* Bookmarks file referenced in the variable `BOOKMARKS_FILE` , and used in the `listBookmarks`  function:

```json file=./code/2-bookmarks.json
```

## Demo

## Repository

If we store the settings and the implementations in a repository (e.g. GitHub) , we just need to reference them in the profile script the same way we have done so far:

```bash
# Update LOCAL_REPO_FULL_PATH with yours
export SETTINGS_FILE="LOCAL_REPO_FULL_PATH/settings.local.json"
source LOCAL_REPO_FULL_PATH/load-custom-profile.sh
```

I recommend you to have a `settings.template.json` with the empty variables as next:

```json file=./code/3-profile-settings.template.json
```

In that way, when you clone the repo locally, you duplicate it, rename copy to `settings.local.json`, and fill the values. Add it to your `gitignore` to avoid pushing it.

## Final Notes

wow, this post is the longest one I have done so far! Do you have another approach for importing scripts or settings? How would you do it? Let me know in the comments below.
