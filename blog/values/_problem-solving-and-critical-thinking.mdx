Define the Problem:

1. Context ()
2. Issue ()
3. Why do we care?

Set a Goal:

Break the problem into different smaller problems (specific areas)

Goal:
* short term or long term

Solution:
* Checkpoints for your solution?
  * would it cover all the cases?
  * It is extensible enough for future cases?


Code:

* improve readability
* add comments if required
* remove duplication
* optimize time/space complexity
* add error handling

Ask other developers opinion.
