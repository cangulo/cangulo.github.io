## What does it mean to be a developer?
First, the definition should include "code", if you don't know how to code, you can't implement solutions. Clear, but what else? Let's focus on the `implement` word, a developer should implement the best solution, in **quality** terms, but given some **circumstances**. It is not the same develop a hotfix for production than a feature on a normal weekly basis.

Nice, so a developer implements solutions given some circumstances. Wait, what about the solution consumer? it will be delivered to someone, let's say it is a client, so, this solution should have some **value** for them. Okay, in summary:

:::info my definition of a Developer
A person that creates value for a client by implementing a solution, taking into account the requirements and the circumstances.

Then, can a developer propose a solution? yes, but if your work is more to propose than to implement, maybe you are an `architect` ðŸ˜œ.

## Quality vs Deadline?

Quality vs Deadline? yeah, that is a big question, and the answer, for me, is composed of two words: **balance** and **circumstances**. 
A developer should always aim for the best quality, without over-engineering the solution, but also taking into account the deadlines. When you have an issue that requires a quick fix, you should work on solving the issue, not into improving the software, the main goal is fixing the area that is failing. Any improvement should be included as a normal feature.
