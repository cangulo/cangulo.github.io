Here are my notes about [Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track by Will Larson](https://staffeng.com/book) book.

## Staff engineer archetypes

1. **Tech Lead**: He guides the approach and execution of a team. It tends to be the first _staff engineer_ experience.
2. **Architect**: He is responsible for the direction, quality, and approach within a specific area.
3. **Solver**: He jumps into problems, finds solutions, and jumps into the next one. He is a trusted agent of the organization.
4. **Right hand**: He extends an executive's attention.

Which is right for you?

Start by listing the kinds of work that energize you. Next, match it with the archetypes and roles available in your company.

## What do Staff engineers actually do?

1. Setting technical direction
2. Mentorship and sponsorship
3. Providing engineering perspective
4. Exploration
5. Being Glue: Have you been in meetings aligning frontend and backend developers? You were the glue then.
6. But will you still write software?
7. Slow but rewarding
