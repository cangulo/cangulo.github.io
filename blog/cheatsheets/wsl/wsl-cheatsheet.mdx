## Format bash scripts for been used in Ubuntu

### User Case

Let's say you are using Windows but you have some bash scripts for a Pipeline (Bitbucket or GH Action) you need to modify, if you install Ubuntu in the WSL you can call and tests those scripts. The only problems is that sometimes there is a formatting issue when Ubuntu tries to read them, the next code fix it:

`sed -i 's/\r//' scripts/*.sh`          ;`

```bash
bashScripts=$(find ./ -type f -name "*.sh") ;\
for script in "${bashScripts[@]}"; do  \
    sed -i 's/\r//' $script; \
done
```
