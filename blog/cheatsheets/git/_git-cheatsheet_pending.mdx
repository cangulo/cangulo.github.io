### Problem

Let's say that before commit changes we want to make sure
Perform actions before or after any commit, let's say, automatize actions following the git workflow. \
In my case, I want to make sure that all my markdown files has any code reference updated. For that, I execute a bash file called `update_sh_code_in_md_files.sh`.

### Solution

Create a githook that is executed before doing a commit.

By default, git create the next set of samples in  `.git/hooks`.

```bash
applypatch-msg.sample
commit-msg.sample
fsmonitor-watchman.sample
post-update.sample
pre-applypatch.sample
pre-commit.sample
prepare-commit-msg.sample
pre-push.sample
pre-rebase.sample
pre-receive.sample
update.sample
```

If a common policy for pre-commit needs to be updated to the repository the `pre-commit` should be located outside the `.git` folder, this will ensure the folder will be tracked in git. Then, we have to configure git to use that path as the source for hooks, this could be done as next:

```bash
git config --local core.hooksPath ./githooks
```

In case we want to set a global policy, it could be done with the same command but adding `--global` as parameter. In my case, all my repositories contains markdown files with reference to code that I want to update 

```bash
git config --global core.hooksPath ./githooks
```

If the hook is set as *global* the configuration file modified will be  `.gitconfig `, at the home user directory. \
On the other hand, if it is *local*, the file modified will be `.config` in  the `.git` folder of the repository.

Next are the lines to be added in the file:
<!-- CODE_START ./resources/git/githooks/gitconfig-with-hooks bash -->
```bash
[core]
	hooksPath = /home/carlos/Documents/github_repositories/cheatsheet/GitCheatsheet/resources/githooks/
```
<!-- CODE_END -->



### Example Pre Commit file example
<!-- TODO: Get the list of files to be modified and add them to the commit as follow -->
<!-- to avoid have them as separate (second) commit when modified -->
<!-- git add /home/carlos/Documents/github_repositories/cheatsheet/BashCheatSheet/BashCheatSheet.md -->

<!-- CODE_START ./resources/git/githooks/pre-commit bash -->
```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "### PRE-COMMIT GLOBAL PROCESS"

/home/carlos/Documents/github_repositories/bashScripts/markdown_helpers/update_code_in_docs/update_sh_code_in_md_files.sh
executionResult=$?

if [ $executionResult -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "###      RESULT OK"
else
    echo "###      RESULT NOT OK"
fi

echo "### PRE-COMMIT GLOBAL PROCESS END"
exit $executionResult
```
CODE_END
