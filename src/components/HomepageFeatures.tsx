        I create value for customers by implementing solutions they need.
        How? analyzing the requirements, doing estimations and, most important, coding.
        I built a personal definition for a developer <a href="./values/developer"> here</a>.

        Motivation, that is one of the keys to progress.
        I build mine from the challenges I face.
        What are the other keys? I think discipline.

        Yes! I almost forgot to mention:
        I have 5 years of experience with dotnet.
        2 with Terraform and AWS.
        I am a AWS Developer Associate certified.
