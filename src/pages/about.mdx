# About me

I'm a software engineer with knowledge in backend and frontend. My background is AWS, .NET Core(C#) and SQL, but I also have worked with Angular and React. 

When I was 15 years old, I did the CISCO CCNA 1 certification,  I like that experience so much that I found my path: New Technologies. After, I studied Telecommunication Engineer at UPC. There, I discovered how much I like coding. In order to follow this passion,  I choose Telematics as the last years' specialization. 

I usually say "I love challenges", any of them is an opportunity to learn and grow, that is my way of seeing life.
