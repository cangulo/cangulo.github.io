You can use it to define what out-of-the-box resources your accounts will have, as well as, add new resources to all the enrolled accounts. It is based on the next workflow:\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph LR\\n  account_request[Account Creation Request]\\n  global_cus[Apply Global Customization]\\n  spec_cus[Apply Account Customization]\\n  account_request--\x3eglobal_cus\\n  global_cus--\x3espec_cus\\n```\\n\\n<i><CaptionDocusaurus label=\\"(simplified) Full schema here\\"  linkIsRelative={false} link=\\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws/aws-control-tower-aft#review-aft-components-and-workflow\\" /></i>\\n\\n\\nLet\'s say we want to create an account, here is an example:\\n\\n```hcl\\nmodule \\"arepabank\\" {\\n  source = \\"./modules/aft-account-request\\"\\n\\n  control_tower_parameters = {\\n    AccountEmail              = \\"arepabank-dev-aa50424c@outlook.com\\"\\n    AccountName               = \\"arepabank-dev\\"\\n  }\\n\\n  custom_fields                = {\\n    client        = \\"arepa\\"\\n    env           = \\"dev\\"\\n  }\\n  account_customizations_name  = \\"dev\\"  # you can use this to group account by stage or client\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThen, depending what you have in the global customization repo (example [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-aft-global-customizations)) you can define resources to be created in ALL the accounts. A use case is to define a role in all the accounts (deployment role), this one can only be assumed by one IAM user (deployment user).\\n\\n```hcl file=./resources/3/global-customizations/iam.roles.tf\\n```\\n\\n<i><CaptionDocusaurus label=\\"Terraform Code in the Global Customization\\"  linkIsRelative={true} link=\\"posts/aws/control-tower/resources/3/global-customizations/iam.roles.tf\\" /></i>\\n\\n\\nBased on the account customization repository (example [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-aft-account-customizations)) and folder named as the `account_customizations_name` parameter, only the resources defined there will be created. We can use this to create different resources per stage, for example different ec2 instances:\\n\\n```bash\\ndev/\\n  ec2.micro.tf\\ntst/\\n  ec2.small.tf\\nacc/\\n  ec2.medium.tf\\nprd/\\n  ec2.large.tf\\n```\\n\\nEach ec2.*.tf file will contain different configuration. \\n\\n```hcl\\nresource \\"aws_instance\\" \\"web\\" {\\n  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id\\n  instance_type = \\"t3.micro\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n<i><CaptionDocusaurus label=\\"ec2.t3.micro.tf\\" /></i>\\n\\n## Is it worth it?\\n\\nFor personal projects and ephemeral workloads: No. Let me list the reasons\\n\\n* There are fixed costs, no matter if you enroll accounts or not. Next are the main ones:\\n  * VPC Endpoints. In my first two post I had to fork the official repo and add flags to disable them.\\n  * KMS keys. I also tried to disable it but major changes were required because it was highly coupled with other resources. \\n  * Log Archive account costs: Only S3, KMS and AWS Config services. Less than the previous two, 4$ maximum. \\n* AWS CodePipelines, CodeBuild and VPC costs are too high for personal projects. There is a `customizations-pipeline` for each account. This means if you want to update all accounts, all pipelines should be executed. I had 12 accounts enrolled and I paid more than 60$ one month. The same work done in the pipelines could be in GitHub workflows as I did in my [previous post](./3-replacing-aws-codepipeline.mdx)\\n\\n![AWS Costs - worst months ](resources/3/aws-costs-worst-months.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nFor my personal projects I\'m going to look for a custom solution with cost based on usage. \\n\\n## References:\\n\\n* [Starting with Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/getting-started-with-control-tower.html)\\n* [control tower user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/guardrails.html)\\n\\n### Git Repositories"},{"id":"/aws/control-tower/3-replacing-aws-codepipeline","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/aws/control-tower/3-replacing-aws-codepipeline","editUrl":"https://github.com/cangulo/cangulo.github.io/blob/main/blog/posts/aws/control-tower/3-replacing-aws-codepipeline.mdx","source":"@site/blog/posts/aws/control-tower/3-replacing-aws-codepipeline.mdx","title":"AWS Control Tower - Replacing CodePipelines","description":"In this post I\'m going to explain how I migrate the Control Tower AFT CodePipelines to GitHub workflows.","date":"2023-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 8, 2023","tags":[{"label":"aws","permalink":"/blog/tags/aws"},{"label":"projects","permalink":"/blog/tags/projects"},{"label":"accounts","permalink":"/blog/tags/accounts"},{"label":"setup","permalink":"/blog/tags/setup"},{"label":"costs","permalink":"/blog/tags/costs"},{"label":"aws-control-tower","permalink":"/blog/tags/aws-control-tower"}],"readingTime":2.43,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Angulo Mascarell","title":"Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/cangulo","imageURL":"https://github.com/cangulo/cangulo/raw/main/profile_picture_preview_icon.png","key":"cangulo"}],"prevItem":{"title":"AWS Control Tower - One year using it","permalink":"/blog/aws/control-tower/4-one-year-after"},"nextItem":{"title":"AWS Control Tower - Reducing Cost 2","permalink":"/blog/aws/control-tower/2-disable-config-in-aft-account"}},"content":":::info\\nIn this post I\'m going to explain how I migrate the Control Tower AFT CodePipelines to GitHub workflows. \\n:::\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## wait, why? \\n\\nSimply, saving costs. Next are the monthly costs for updating 12 AWS accounts. \\n\\n![AWS Costs - worst months](resources/3/codepipeline-costs.png)\\n\\n\\n| Service                      | Service total | December 2022 | January 2023 |\\n| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |\\n| VPC costs                    | $31.86        | $30.36        | $1.50        |\\n| CodePipeline costs           | $12.00        | $2.00         | $10.00       |\\n| Key Management Service costs | $11.98        | $5.99         | $5.99        |\\n| CodeBuild costs              | $5.49         | $3.54         | $1.95        |\\n\\n* VPC Costs: I described in my previous post how to reduce it through a custom flag.\\n* Code Pipeline and Codebuild costs: The main cost here is related to pipelines executions. We will dive into in the next section.\\n* KMS: Control Tower for AFT Cost for using the secrets created with Control Tower AFT\\n\\n\\n### Pipelines\\n\\n\\nAccount customization has two type: \\n* aft-global-customization in the repository [learn-terraform-aft-account-customizations](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-aft-account-customizations)  \\n* aft-account-customization in the repository [learn-terraform-aft-global-customizations](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-aft-global-customizations)  \\n\\nBoth are in the same CodePipeline model `{ACCOUNT_ID}-customizations-pipeline`:\\n\\n![AWS Costs - example ](resources/3/codepipeline-example.png)\\n\\nThere is one pipeline replica for each AWS account:\\n\\n![AWS Costs - list ](resources/3/codepipeline-list.png)\\n\\nSo, for updating all the accounts, all the pipelines should be executed. \\n\\n### Migrating to GH workflows\\n\\nLet me first set the scope: I want to reduce the CodePipeline cost by executing GH workflows instead. \\n\\nMy initial approach is to create GH workflows in the `global-customization` and `account-customization` repositories to apply customizations to any account. This will work for created account, but if I create a new one that will still go through the CodePipeline. \\n\\nOkey, let\'s start:\\n\\nFirst, let me list the pipelines specs:\\n* [aft-account-customizations](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory/blob/60ee77b6a90e4bc6a96a60c8d8105d71ba5d3543/modules/aft-customizations/buildspecs/aft-account-customizations-terraform.yml)\\n* [aft-global-customizations](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory/blob/60ee77b6a90e4bc6a96a60c8d8105d71ba5d3543/modules/aft-customizations/buildspecs/aft-global-customizations-terraform.yml)\\n\\nBoth share a common structure:\\n* [install](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory/blob/60ee77b6a90e4bc6a96a60c8d8105d71ba5d3543/modules/aft-customizations/buildspecs/aft-global-customizations-terraform.yml#L7): setup the environment variables for the execution and install the dependencies\\n* [pre_build](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory/blob/60ee77b6a90e4bc6a96a60c8d8105d71ba5d3543/modules/aft-customizations/buildspecs/aft-global-customizations-terraform.yml#L63): execute a python script\\n* [build](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory/blob/60ee77b6a90e4bc6a96a60c8d8105d71ba5d3543/modules/aft-customizations/buildspecs/aft-global-customizations-terraform.yml#L71):  \\n  * build `backend.tf` and `aft-providers.tf` from the templates `backend.jinja` and `aft-providers.jinja`. jinja is language that combined with python simplify files templates filling, in this case, help us build those terraform files dynamically for each account.\\n  * terraform init\\n  * terraform apply\\n* [post_build](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory/blob/60ee77b6a90e4bc6a96a60c8d8105d71ba5d3543/modules/aft-customizations/buildspecs/aft-global-customizations-terraform.yml#L115): execute a python script, useful for a post clean up actions\\n\\nIn order to keep it simple, I\'m going to skip the pre_build and post_build part.

I didn\'t expect this one because I didn\'t use AFT during that month.\\n* Other services ( `S3` ,`DynamoDB` ,`Backup` ,`EC2-Instances` ,`CloudWatch` ) have no cost or less than 0.10.\\n\\n### Questions\\n\\n* What AWS Config does ? Can I reduce it cost ? \\n* What does the operation `EU-ElasticIP:IdleAddress` do? How can I decrease this cost? \\n* Why KMS cost increase in March if I didn\'t use AFT? How can I decrease it?\\n\\n\\n## What AWS Config does? Can I reduce it cost? \\n\\nAWS Config is a AWS service that allow us to record and evaluate resources configurations. You can check the full description [here](https://aws.amazon.com/config/?nc1=h_ls). \\nThis service is been used by the AWS Control Tower as described next:\\n\\nAWS Control Tower has a feature named [Guardrails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/guardrails.html), those are rules validated against resources created in enrolled accounts. This provides governance to AWS environments. \\nThose Guardrails can be preventive (ensuring your account maintain compliance) or Detective (detect noncompliance resources) based on the behavior. \\nThe detective guardrails are implemented using AWS Config rules. \\nThis means Control Tower call AWS Config to validate the configuration of the resources when a detective guardrails is active.\\n\\nokey, too much theory, the most important, next are the two detective guardrails activated by default in a landing zone:\\n\\n![Guardrails detectives](resources/2/guardrails-default-detectives.png)\\n\\n:::danger\\nThe next approach works for me because I\'m using AFT sporadically and for personal projects. I don\'t recommend it for companies because resource history might be required for compliance.\\n:::\\n\\nAction done: \\n1. Go to AWS Organizations. Create a OU, I name it `outside-act`.\\n2. Move the AFT account to the new OU.\\n3. Check it is not enrolled.\\n\\n![aws-ct-account-outside-ou](resources/2/aws-ct-account-outside-ou.png)\\n\\n4. Open the AWS Console, login using the AFT Account, go to AWS Config, open Settings, click on `Edit`. and select stop recording, save it.\\n\\n![aws-config-settings](resources/2/aws-config-settings.png)\\n![aws-config-settings-edit](resources/2/aws-config-settings-edit.png)\\n![aws-config-setting-recorder-off](resources/2/aws-config-setting-recorder-off.png)\\n\\n\\n![costs-after-disable-aws-config-recorder](resources/2/costs-after-disable-aws-config-recorder.png)\\n\\nAfter disabling Recorder on April 19 the cost was reduced from `0.30 $` per day to `0.03 $`\\n\\n| Service   | 2022-04-16 | 2022-04-17 | 2022-04-18 | 2022-04-19 | 2022-04-20 | 2022-04-21 | 2022-04-22 |\\n| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\\n| Config($) | 0.296      | **0.296**  | **0.236**  | **0.008**  | 0.008      | 0.008      | 0.008      |\\n\\n## What does the operation `EU-ElasticIP:IdleAddress` do? How can I decrease this cost? \\n\\nI discovered there were two Elastic IP addresses not linked to any EC2 instances, this is why it is been charged in Idle state.

I recommend you read it before continuing. Basic knowledge about AWS and Terraform is required.\\n:::\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nWhenever I want to start a new project, I create an AWS account for each environment, I do it to separate domains and costs. So far, I have been doing this manually, but then I discover the Account Factory for Terraform (AFT) as part of the AWS Control Tower services. \\n\\nAFT defines a GitOps process to automate the account creation and update. It is based on two main elements: \\n1. Git repositories where the account creation request and customizations are defined.\\n2. AWS resources used in the account creation/update process. All of them are based on the repository code. Some of them are CodePipeline, Dynamo tables, Lambdas, and Step Functions.\\n\\nI don\'t want to go into details, but I think it is worth mentioning that this automatization simplifies the whole process, not only because we avoid manual operations (that is always nice, right?), but because it allows us to align different AWS accounts.\\n\\nA customization example could be to define a Budget after creating the account. We can add a notification when we are close to a maximum amount (in fact, this was my main goal at first, to avoid any unexpected cost \ud83d\ude01). Next are other examples:\\n\\n* Create default resources like S3 buckets\\n* Add SSM parameters to describe the account\\n* Add custom policies\\n\\n:::info\\nI\'m not going to go into the customization details in this article. I just want to point out a few examples. I will explain it in a separate post in the future.\\n:::\\n\\n## Problem: Costs\\n\\nAFT does not have a cost itself, the cost depends [on the resources deployed and used](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/aft-pricing.html). Next are the main costs per resource after a few days of using it:\\n\\n1. VPC Endpoints: [billed hourly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html).\\n2. NatGateway.\\n\\nI found it in the Cost Explorer of my root account, grouping by API Operation:\\n\\n![costs](./resources/1/costs-using-aws-ct-aft.png)\\n\\n## Solution\\n\\n### Delete the VPC Endpoints when not used\\n\\nThe AFT repository ([terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory)) offers  the flag `aft_vpc_endpoints` to enable/disable the VPC Endpoints. As those are billed hourly, it doesn\'t make sense to have them on if you are not using them. So, to save costs, only turn them on before requesting a new account, and once it is finished, turn them off. The idea is simple, let\'s see that in practice:\\n\\nThe basic TF code that creates the AFT infrastructure is:\\n\\n```terraform\\nmodule \\"aft\\" {\\n  source                      = \\"github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory\\"\\n\\n  ct_management_account_id    = var.ct_management_account_id\\n  log_archive_account_id      = var.log_archive_account_id\\n  audit_account_id            = var.audit_account_id\\n  aft_management_account_id   = var.aft_management_account_id\\n  ct_home_region              = var.ct_home_region\\n  tf_backend_secondary_region = \\"us-west-2\\"\\n\\n  vcs_provider                                  = \\"github\\"\\n  account_request_repo_name                     = \\"${var.github_username}/learn-terraform-aft-account-request\\"\\n  global_customizations_repo_name               = \\"${var.github_username}/learn-terraform-aft-global-customizations\\"\\n  account_customizations_repo_name              = \\"${var.github_username}/learn-terraform-aft-account-customizations\\"\\n  account_provisioning_customizations_repo_name = \\"${var.github_username}/learn-terraform-aft-account-provisioning-customizations\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nOnce we have created the infrastructure by executing a `terraform apply`, the VPC endpoints are enabled by default, we process to send the account creation request (explained in the [tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/aws-control-tower-aft#create-aws-aft-organizational-unit-and-account)). Once it is finished, we set the `aft_vpc_endpoints` flag to false:\\n\\n```terraform {5}\\nmodule \\"aft\\" {\\n  source                      = \\"github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory\\"\\n\\n  ...\\n\\n  aft_vpc_endpoints                             = false\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe reexecute `terraform apply` and done! VPC endpoints deleted and costs reduced!\\n\\n### Delete the NAT related resources when not used\\n\\nMaybe, the first approach we think is to manually delete the NAT resources. Then, before queuing any account creation request, we use Terraform to recreate them. That might work, but it involves manual intervention on in the AWS Console for every request, we don\'t want that. \\n\\nSo, taking into account that the AFT code is in a GitHub repository, I thought it was better to fork it and add a new flag to conditionally create the NAT resources. So, I did the next steps:\\n\\n1. I forked the AWS GH repo [aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory) in [cangulo-aws-aft/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory](https://github.com/cangulo-aws-aft/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory).\\n2. I created a new flag called `aft_vpc_nat_gateway` following the `aft_vpc_endpoints` model.\\n3. I modify the NAT resources to depend on the new flag. \\n\\nEverything is done in [this commit](https://github.com/cangulo-aws-aft/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory/commit/d8cfd2584f4cec37e1a91d213f823191cec201d3).\\n\\nThen, I simply update the \\"aft\\" module source to my fork and provide the new flag. Next is the result:\\n\\n```terraform {22}\\nmodule \\"aft\\" {\\n\\n  # source = \\"github.com/cangulo-aws-aft/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory\\" # repo in the cloud\\n\\n  # source                      = \\"github.com/cangulo-aws-aft/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory\\"\\n  source = \\"../terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory\\" # repo in the same local path\\n\\n  ct_management_account_id    = var.ct_management_account_id\\n  log_archive_account_id      = var.log_archive_account_id\\n  audit_account_id            = var.audit_account_id\\n  aft_management_account_id   = var.aft_management_account_id\\n  ct_home_region              = var.ct_home_region\\n  tf_backend_secondary_region = var.tf_backend_secondary_region\\n\\n  vcs_provider                                  = \\"github\\"\\n  account_request_repo_name                     = \\"${var.github_username}/account-request\\"\\n  account_provisioning_customizations_repo_name = \\"${var.github_username}/account-provisioning-customizations\\"\\n  global_customizations_repo_name               = \\"${var.github_username}/global-customizations\\"\\n  account_customizations_repo_name              = \\"${var.github_username}/account-customizations\\"\\n\\n  aft_feature_delete_default_vpcs_enabled = false\\n  aft_vpc_aws_nat_gateway                 = false\\n  aft_vpc_endpoints                       = false\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Reduced Costs\\n\\n![reduced-costs](./resources/1/reduced-costs.jpg)\\n\\nI deactivated the VPC Endpoints since the day 11, NAT costs disappeared next days. \\n\\n## References:\\n\\n* Youtube Tutorial for setting up AWS Control Tower: [Enable AWS Control Tower for Existing Organizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwRy0t8nfgM)  \\n* [Manage AWS Accounts Using Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/aws-control-tower-aft#create-aws-aft-organizational-unit-and-account)  \\n* [Account Factory for Terraform](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-control-tower-account-factory-for-terraform/)\\n\\n### Git Repositories\\n\\n[learn-terraform-aft-account-provisioning-customizations](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-aft-account-provisioning-customizations)  \\n[learn-terraform-aft-account-customizations](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-aft-account-customizations)  \\n[learn-terraform-aft-global-customizations](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-aft-global-customizations)  \\n[learn-terraform-aft-account-request](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-aft-account-request)"},{"id":"bash/5-interactive-bookmarks-v2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/bash/5-interactive-bookmarks-v2","editUrl":"https://github.com/cangulo/cangulo.github.io/blob/main/blog/posts/bash/5-interactive-bookmarks-v2/5-interactive-bookmarks-v2.mdx","source":"@site/blog/posts/bash/5-interactive-bookmarks-v2/5-interactive-bookmarks-v2.mdx","title":"Interactive bookmarks menu v2","description":"In this post, I am going to improve the interactive bookmark I created in a previous post.","date":"2020-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 21, 2020","tags":[{"label":"linux","permalink":"/blog/tags/linux"},{"label":"productivity","permalink":"/blog/tags/productivity"},{"label":"hack","permalink":"/blog/tags/hack"},{"label":"bash","permalink":"/blog/tags/bash"},{"label":"zsh","permalink":"/blog/tags/zsh"},{"label":"terminal","permalink":"/blog/tags/terminal"}],"readingTime":3.45,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Angulo Mascarell","title":"Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/cangulo","imageURL":"https://github.com/cangulo/cangulo/raw/main/profile_picture_preview_icon.png","key":"cangulo"}],"prevItem":{"title":"AWS Control Tower - Reducing Cost 1","permalink":"/blog/aws/control-tower/1-delete-vpc-endpoints-and-nat"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to use a repository for importing your bash scripts and shortcuts","permalink":"/blog/bash/4-create-config-repo"}},"content":"import Gif from \'/src/components/gif.js\'\\n\\nIn this post, I am going to improve the interactive bookmark I created in a [previous post](../1-interactive-bookmarks/1-interactive-bookmarks.mdx).\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Requirements\\n* Linux (I\'m using [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io), a Ubuntu-based distro, try it!)\\n* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) command-line fuzzy finder\\n* Remember to add execution permissions to the scripts through `chmod +x`\\n* This article improves the interactive bookmark menu implemented in the previous post: [_Create an interactive bookmarks menu in your terminal_](../1-interactive-bookmarks/1-interactive-bookmarks.mdx)\\n\\n## Improvements introduced\\n\\n1.

Bookmarks now have two properties: _name_ and _path_. \\n\\n```json file=code/bookmarks.json#L3-L6\\n```\\n\\n* name: string to identify the organization / custom name folder. Without spaces. e.g. for cangulo-actions -> Actions\\n* path: full path to first layer directories mentioned before.\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Full Bookmark file</summary>\\n\\n```json file=code/bookmarks.json\\n```\\n\\n<CaptionDocusaurus label=\\"bookmarks\\" linkIsRelative={true} link=\\"posts/bash/5-interactive-bookmarks-v2/code/bookmarks.json\\" />\\n\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n2. The path to the bookmarks file is set in the environment variable `$BOOKMARKS_FILE`. We don\'t have it hardcoded in the function.\\n\\n```bash file=./code/listbookmarks.sh#L5 {1}\\n```\\n\\n3. I now use `jq` to query both attributes `(.[] | [.name,.path])` and output them in the columns `[\\"NAME\\", \\"PATH\\"]`  as a tab-separated-value `@tsv`:\\n\\n```bash file=./code/listbookmarks.sh#L5-L8\\n```\\n![jq-updated](jq-updated.png)\\n\\nProblem: columns are not aligned (see _oldprojects_ row)\\n\\n4. In order to align the `jq` output before piping it to `fzf`, I use the `column -t` command. [Reference](https://linux.die.net/man/1/column)\\n```bash file=./code/listbookmarks.sh#L5-L10 {5}\\n```\\n![column](column.png)\\n\\n5. Once a bookmark is selected, the full row is returned. I\\n\\n![fzf_return_full_row](fzf_return_full_row.gif)\\n\\nThen, I have to extract the path. First, I delete the repeated spaces (`tr -s \' \'`). Secondly, I choose the second column(`cut -f2 -d \' \'`). The `-d \' \'` parameter is to set columns delimiter to a whitespace.\\n\\n![trim-selection](trim-selection.png)\\n\\n5. I have created the function `lsf` to list the current directories using `fzf`, navigate to the one selected and execute a command provided as first parameter `$1`. In our case `code`. \\n\\n```bash file=./code/listbookmarks.sh#L27-L37 {8}\\n```\\n\\nPlease note the ` eval \\"\\\\$command .\\"` statement for executing the command provided.\\n\\n## Adding this to your Terminal Profile\\n\\nYou can add this into your Bash / Zsh profile. You can follow the next steps:\\n\\n1. Define your bookmarks in a json file following the _name,path_ model\\n2. In your profile, append its path in the `$BOOKMARKS_FILE` variable\\n3. Append the functions `listBookmarks` and `lsf`.\\n4. Append a call to the `listBookmarks` function at the end of the profile, so every time you open a terminal it execute it. \\n\\n## lsf function\\n\\nI just want to mention you can use the  `lsf` function separately to make navigation through directories faster. Also, remember it accepts as a parameter a command to execute in the directory selected. Give it a try and add import it in your profile.\\n\\n![lsf_faster_navigation](lsf_faster_navigation.gif)\\n\\n## Final Notes\\n\\nDo you see any other improvement to include? What commands would you provide when using `lsf` ? Share them in the comments below.\\n\\n<Gif id=\\"UtEUhkfriklonVdweC\\"  />"},{"id":"bash/4-create-config-repo","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/bash/4-create-config-repo","editUrl":"https://github.com/cangulo/cangulo.github.io/blob/main/blog/posts/bash/4-create-config-repo/4-create-config-repo.mdx","source":"@site/blog/posts/bash/4-create-config-repo/4-create-config-repo.mdx","title":"How to use a repository for importing your bash scripts and shortcuts","description":"In this post, I will explain how to load custom variables by reading a JSON file, this will be done every time we open a Terminal.

Export the path to the JSON settings. My convention is to call this variable as `SETTINGS_FILE`.\\n2. Call a script to load all the variables and functions using the previous settings. Let\'s call this script `load-custom-profile.sh`.\\n\\nNext is the code for that.

In that way, it will be available for other scripts. Please check this [link](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/bash-variables-export) for more details.\\n\\n### load-custom-profile.sh\\n\\nThis script should perform the next actions:\\n\\n* Verify `$SETTINGS_FILE` is defined and valid:\\n  * String is not empty\\n  * Path provided exists\\n* Read the JSON file and export the variables. The command is based on `jq` and `eval` as explained in my [previous post](../3-load-vars/3-load-vars.mdx) for more details. The main difference now is the use of the `export` command, following the pattern: `export KEY=\'VALUE\'`\\n\\n```bash file=./code/load-custom-profile.sh\\n```\\n\\nNext are the scripts stored in `$SCRIPTS_FOLDER`:\\n\\n* aliases:\\n\\n<Tabs>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"bash\\" label=\\"bash\\" default>\\n\\n```bash file=./code/scripts/aliases-bash.sh\\n```\\n<CaptionDocusaurus label=\\"aliases-bash.sh\\" linkIsRelative={true} link=\\"posts/bash/4-create-config-repo/code/scripts/aliases-bash.sh\\" />\\n\\n  </TabItem>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"zsh\\" label=\\"zsh\\">\\n\\n```bash file=./code/scripts/aliases-zsh.sh\\n```\\n<CaptionDocusaurus label=\\"aliases-zsh.sh\\" linkIsRelative={true} link=\\"posts/bash/4-create-config-repo/code/scripts/aliases-zsh.sh\\" />\\n\\n  </TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n* functions:\\n\\n```bash file=./code/scripts/functions.sh\\n```\\n\\n* Bookmarks file referenced in the variable `BOOKMARKS_FILE` , and used in the `listBookmarks`  function:\\n\\n```json file=./code/2-bookmarks.json\\n```\\n\\n## Demo\\n\\n![demo](demo.gif)\\n\\n## Repository\\n\\nIf we store the settings and the implementations in a repository (e.g. GitHub) , we just need to reference them in the profile script the same way we have done so far:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Update LOCAL_REPO_FULL_PATH with yours\\nexport SETTINGS_FILE=\\"LOCAL_REPO_FULL_PATH/settings.local.json\\"\\nsource LOCAL_REPO_FULL_PATH/load-custom-profile.sh\\n```\\n\\nI recommend you to have a `settings.template.json` with the empty variables as next:\\n\\n```json file=./code/3-profile-settings.template.json\\n```\\n\\nIn that way, when you clone the repo locally, you duplicate it, rename copy to `settings.local.json`, and fill the values.

What happens if we move that file to another folder? We would have to update the function. For one variable this doesn\'t seem to be a problem, right? But what if it is hardcoded in more functions? we would have to update them all, that is not extensible!\\n\\nLet\'s define two terms here:\\n\\n* Behavior: Functions implementation.\\n* Configuration: Input parameters that the function relies on. In this case, `bookmarksFile`. \\n\\nBy setting all the parameters outside the functions, we are creating a central place for the configuration.\\n\\n```bash file=./code/1-declare-vars.sh#L4-\\n```\\n\\nAnd by calling those from the functions:\\n\\n```bash file=./code/2-add-functions.sh#L8-L9\\n```\\n\\nWe are **decoupling** configuration from behavior.  If we want to migrate or share this setup, we won\'t need to look at the function implementations, we would only need to update the parameters.\\n\\n<Gif id=\\"d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY\\" />\\n\\n## One extra mile: Define the parameters as JSON\\n\\nLet\'s migrate the variables to a JSON file as follows. Please note all the paths are now absolute.\\n\\n```json file=./code/3-vars.json\\n```\\n\\nTo set the JSON keys as the parameters name we have to:\\n1. Define the json file path. We will consider those as the main settings.\\n2. Use the `jq` command to retrieve the keys and values.\\n3. Use the `eval` command to execute the `key=value`  for each one.\\n\\nNext is the solution, replace the variables declaration in your profile for this.\\n\\n```bash\\nsettingsFile=\\"/home/cangulo/repos/cangulo-blog/cangulo.github.io/blog/posts/bash/3-setup-custom-env-variables/code/3-vars.json\\"\\neval \\"$(jq -r \'to_entries | .[] | .key + \\"=\\" + (.value | @sh)\' <$settingsFile)\\"\\n```\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>In case you want to go into the solution details.

Everything in this article works for PowerShell 5.1 and later.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\nIf you are a PowerShell (a.k.a. PS) user, I\'m sure at some point you repeat operations as navigating to a specific folder (e.g. your local GitHub repository). Maybe you run a script to clean or prepare your environment. Let\'s define those two scenarios as next:\\n\\n1. Go to your local git repository folder.\\n   - Code to execute: `cd .\\\\source\\\\repos\\\\`\\n2. Execute a script.\\n   - Code to execute: `$HOME\\\\source\\\\repos\\\\TaskManager\\\\startTaskManagerScript.ps1`\\n\\n## What is the PS Profile?\\n\\nThe PS Profile is a script that is run when the console starts, setting custom user settings as variables, aliases or functions. We can also use it to execute custom commands to prepare our local environment. Check your `$Profile` variable to know where your profile is stored.\\n\\n![Profile variables](./2020-08-26-configuring-powershell-profile/Profile-variable.png)\\n\\n## Shortcuts\\n\\nThe shortcuts we are going to set are functions or aliases depending on the following situations:\\n\\n1. For a command with static parameters, we will write functions. For example, `goToRepos` as a shortcut for `cd $HOME\\\\source\\\\repos`. The code will be:\\n\\n`function NAME { COMMAND_WITH_PARAMS }` -> `function goToRepos { cd $HOME\\\\source\\\\repos }`\\n\\n2. We will define an alias for frequently used commands which we call with different parameters. For example, we use `Select-String` to filter file content as next:\\n\\n```powershell\\nSelect-String [-Pattern] PATTERN [-Path] PATH\\n```\\n\\n![](ss-executed.png)\\n\\nInstead of writing `Select-String`, we could write `ss`. Next is the alias:\\n\\n`New-Alias -Name ALIAS -Value COMMAND` -> `New-Alias -Name ss -Value Select-String`\\n\\nIn our case, we want to avoid typing the full _startTaskManagerScript_, so we set that path as COMMAND.\\n\\n`New-Alias -Name startTaskManagerAPI -Value $HOME\\\\source\\\\repos\\\\TaskManager\\\\startTaskManagerScript.ps1`\\n\\n### Creating the profile\\n\\nLet\'s create and open the PS profile, execute the following command in PS: `code $PROFILE`, you should see the code editor empty. Considering that both commands share the `$HOME\\\\source\\\\repos` path, we could define a variable to short them as next:\\n\\n```powershell\\n# Variables\\n\\n$localRepo = $HOME + \'\\\\source\\\\repos\'\\n\\n# Functions\\n\\nfunction goToRepos { cd $localRepo }\\n\\n# Alias\\n\\nNew-Alias -Name startTaskManagerAPI -Value $localRepo\\\\TaskManager\\\\startTaskManagerScript.ps1\\n```\\n\\nPlease note the `$localrepo` variable will be available during the PS session. This means you can use it anytime, just as the variable `$HOME`. Paste the previous code into your profile and save it.\\n\\nOpen a new PS window. Maybe the next error will show up:\\n\\n![Problem Signature Profile](./2020-08-26-configuring-powershell-profile/digitally-signed-problem.png)\\n\\nThat is because PS has an execution policy that only accepts signed scripts (`AllSigned`). We need to change it to `RemoteSigned` to verify the signature for remote scripts, but not locals. We have to do it using the following command:\\n\\n`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`. Now we are good to go, open a new PS and try to execute the shortcuts we defined. \\n\\n\\n![Shortcuts execution](./2020-08-26-configuring-powershell-profile/shortcuts-execution.png)\\n\\n:::tip use the autocomplete feature!\\nYou don\'t need to write your aliases or functions completely. Just type the initial part and press `tab`.\\n:::\\n\\nAnd we\'re done! I hope this helps you to save time when using PS. Do you know any other tweak to be more productive?
