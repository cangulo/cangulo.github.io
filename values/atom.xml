        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What does it means to be a developer?</h2><p>First, the definition should include &quot;code&quot;, if you don&#x27;t know how to code, you can&#x27;t implement solutions. Okey, but what else? Let&#x27;s focus on the <code>implement</code> word, a developer should implement the best solution, in <strong>quality</strong> terms, but given some <strong>circumstances</strong>. It is not the same develop a hot fix for production than to develop a feature in the normal weekly basis.</p><p>Nice, so a developer implements solutions given some circumstances. That is my definition. Then, can a developer propose solution? yes, but if your work is more to propose than to implement, maybe you are an <code>architect</code> ðŸ˜œ.</p><h2>Quality vs Deadline?</h2><p>Quality vs Deadline? yeah, that is a big question, and the answer, for me, is compose by two words: <strong>balance </strong>and <strong>circumstances</strong>.
A developer should always aim for the best quality, without over engineering the solution, but also taking into account the deadlines. When you have an issue that requires a quick fix, you should work on solving the issue, not into improving the software, the main goal is  fixing the area that is failing. Any improvement should be included as a normal feature. </p><div></div><h2>Did you like it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devops - definition]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Devops - definition</h2><p>You know how happy I was when I discovered Terraform (TF) and deployment pipelines? A lot, but why? simple, before the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concept, developers should provide the executable file to sys admins, then, they deploy it into the servers for each environment.  This was quite a manual process. </p><p>Then the IaC concept appears, developers code the infrastructure they need (Lambdas, EC2 instance, etc) and link the solution code to those. When a feature was delivered, a pipeline to deploy the IaC and the solution code is executed. The first environment to be deployed is TST, once it has been fully tested, we can promote the same code to ACC, again, once it has been tested, it can be promoted to PRD. In all the process, we are sure all the Infrastructure and the solution is the same for all the environments. Any resource that is created in TST, will also be created in all the other envs, in other words, we trust IaC framework to make sure the infrastructure is the same for all the envs.
This simplifies the deployment process making developers own the features in all the environments, ensuring the same solution will be deployed to different envs without requiring manual intervention. </p><div></div><h2>Did you like it?
